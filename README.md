# SnakeGame
This is Snake game, developed by HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
Its a one player game, It will count Score and also show HighScores as well. User can play it with Keyborad arrows key, with up key
snake will move to upwards and viceversa for other arrow keys as well
Motive of this is to get the snake to one point, Everytime Snake touch that Blinking point, Snake will get bigger and User will see that point on that Playing board again. 
If Snake touch itelf, User will get out, have to start again.
there is Music as well. Whenever snake catches that point or it gets out. 

#Making of code
There is only 1 file, index.html
With the help of markup features like using HTML tags and Head tags and title, I made up the intro of the page, In the body section You can see class and id. 
then wrote a connected a JavaScript with html file and css file as well. Because styling is important for this game. 
Also the javaScript should work for this.
